# MathKids

This is a small project to build a simple web app to help my children to learn mathematics. It's a PWA built with [Angular 9](https://angular.io/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), and [Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/). Feel free to clone it, fork it, and use it, also any feedback is welcome.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
